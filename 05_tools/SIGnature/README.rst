SIGnature: Scoring the Importance of Genes
================================================================================

**SIGnature** is a Python package that empowers researchers to rapidly query gene sets across diverse single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets through precomputed gene attribution scores.

Beyond querying capabilities, SIGnature also enables the generation of attribution scores on novel scRNA-seq data, allowing seamless integration with our collection of annotated studies.

Download & Install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SIGnature API is under activate development. The latest development API can be downloaded and installed as follows::

    git clone https://github.com/genentech/signature.git
    cd signature
    pip install -e .

SIGnature release versions can be installed via::

    pip install sc-signature

Precomputed attribution scores can be downloaded from Zenodo:

To generate attribution scores on new data, helper files can be downloaded from Zenodo:

SIGnature currently supports calculating attributions using the following models:


1. `SCimilarity <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08411-y>`_: pretrained weights included in helper files, but can also be downloaded here: https://zenodo.org/records/15729925
2. `scFoundation <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02305-7>`_: pretrained weights can be downloaded here: https://huggingface.co/genbio-ai/scFoundation/tree/main
3. `scVI <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0229-2>`_: pretrained weights for scVI models trained on CZI Census data can be downloaded here: https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/census-models
4. `SSL-scTab <https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-024-00934-3>`_: pretrained weights for self-supervised learning models trained on scTab data can be downloaded here: https://huggingface.co/TillR/sc_pretrained/tree/main
